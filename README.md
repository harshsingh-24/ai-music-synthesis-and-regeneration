# ai-music-synthesis-and-regeneration
Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are powerful models that have achieved excellent performance on difficult learning tasks having temporal dependencies. I propose a generative RNN model using LSTM that create new music with well-formed structure and melody conventions without predefining music composition rules to the models.
